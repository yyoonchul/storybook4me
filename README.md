- Save to your bookshelf, set public/private, and browse community picks in Explore.

## Product flow
1) Landing hero: enter an idea and start a story instantly.  
2) Characters: add your family or pull from preset Storybook4me friends.

4) Library: manage your bookshelf, switch public/private, or delete.  
5) Explore: search/sort community stories by category, popularity, or recency.
