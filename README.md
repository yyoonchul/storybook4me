# Storybook4me

Personalized, AI-assisted storybooks made for your kid — type an idea, pick your family, and watch a 14-spread book appear in seconds.

## Watch the launch film
- [Launch video placeholder](#) — drop the main cinematic cut here.
- [1-min product loop](#) — quick tour for busy parents.
- [How it works (studio walkthrough)](#) — screen recording with narration.

## Quick pitch
- Turn a single prompt into a full story draft almost instantly.
- Build your family cast (or use Storybook4me friends) and keep them reusable.
- Co-edit with an AI storyteller that can rewrite pages on request.
- Save to your bookshelf, set public/private, and browse community picks in Explore.

## Video beats to script
- Open on the landing hero: type “Twins Mia and Noah build a rocket to the moon...” and click create — show the spinner, then the studio loading in.
- Cut to “My Family”: add mom/dad/child avatars and reuse them in the story settings.
- Glide through the Studio: pick an art style, hit Generate, flip through the 14 spreads, tweak a page, and ask the AI chat to “make page 5 funnier”.
- End on Bookshelf & Explore: toggle a book to public, open a card, and show the shareable preview.
